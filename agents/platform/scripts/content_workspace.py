"""Broker-owned git working trees the agent never gets a path to.

Why this exists
---------------
Today the agent authors files on a shared volume and the broker runs `git` in
that same directory, at a working directory the agent chooses and reports. Every
config-driven code-execution path found against the broker follows from that one
arrangement: a repo-local `.git/config` the agent can write is read by a `git`
holding the cloud credentials, and `.git/hooks/pre-commit` needs no unusual argv
at all — an ordinary `git commit` runs it.

That surface cannot be closed by enumeration. `filter.<name>.smudge` and
`alias.<name>` take an arbitrary name *inside* the config key, so there is no
finite set of keys to deny, and `url.<host>.insteadOf` survives every transport
control because the attacker's URL is `https` too.

So the boundary moves. The agent stops handing over a directory and starts
handing over content: `{path, bytes}` pairs plus a branch and a message. The
broker owns the tree, on its own volume, and the agent has no name for it. There
is no `.git` for the agent to write into because there is no path it can reach.

What is a control here and what is only geometry
------------------------------------------------
Two different things hold this together and they are not equally strong.

*Structural, and checked:* `assert_disjoint_roots` refuses to arm the feature if
the tree root and the agent-shared workspace root overlap. That is an executed
property rather than a comment, which is the point — a future edit that points
both at the same volume fails at startup instead of silently reopening
everything above.

*Geometry, and not checked here:* in the sidecar deployment the tree root lives
on the broker's own emptyDir, which the agent container does not mount. Nothing
in this process can verify that. It is the same argument the credential proxy
already makes twice — about `$HOME/.gitconfig` and about `KUBECTL_KUBERC` — and
it is exactly as weak here as it is there. The operator can defeat it in one
line of a PlatformAgent CR, because `spec.deployment.extraVolumeMounts` is
appended to the agent container unvalidated. The genuinely structural version of
this is the pod split, where there is no shared mount to name.

Paths are validated once, in `repo_relative`, and the same validator runs on
reads and on writes. One parser, both directions: a checker that disagrees with
itself about what `manifests/../.git/config` means is the defect class that has
produced every Critical in this project so far.

Two things that are easy to state and were not true until they were enforced.
No response carries an absolute filesystem path — including the error
responses, which is where one leaks, because git quotes paths in its own
messages and nobody writes an error thinking about it. `_redact` is what makes
that a property rather than an intention, and it scrubs every absolute path
rather than the two this module happens to know the names of. And every verb takes a lock for its
whole duration, because the handler is threaded and each verb is a
read-then-act on a tree another verb may delete or reset underneath it.

        # one handle genuinely interleave, and every verb here is a
        # read-then-act on a working tree that the other verb is entitled to
        # delete or reset underneath it. Two interleavings were reproduced
        # before this went in. `close` between a commit's `checkout` and its
        # write loop leaves the commit re-creating the tree it just removed,
        # with no handle registered against it -- the same orphan class the
        # failed-clone fix closes, on a path that fix does not cover. And a
        # second `commit` inside the first has its `clean -fdxq` delete the
        # first's files, so the first either fails on a pathspec that no longer
        # matches or lands its commit on the other's branch while reporting its
        # own.
        #
        # Reentrant because the verbs call `get`, which takes it too.
        #
        # Coarse on purpose, and the cost is real rather than theoretical: this
        # is held across `clone`, `fetch` and `push`, so it is held across
        # network I/O bounded only by the executor's timeout, not by anything
        # here. Measured: a `get` on an *unrelated* workspace blocked 2.7s
        # behind a 3s clone. The store therefore serves one request at a time,
        # worst case for as long as the timeout allows, and that includes
        # `close` -- the verb an operator reaches for when they want the tree
        # gone. Note that `max_workspaces` advertises a concurrency this
        # forbids: eight may be open, one may be doing anything.
        #
        # Still the right trade for a single agent Pod publishing one pull
        # request at a time, and a per-workspace lock would still need this one

        Every docstring in this module says no response carries a filesystem
        path, and until this existed that was an assertion with nothing
        enforcing it: git's own errors quote absolute paths freely (`fatal:
        could not create work tree dir '<root>/<handle>/repo'`), and `_git` puts
        500 bytes of stderr on the wire. An error message is exactly where a
        path leaks, because nobody writes an error message thinking about it.

        Three passes, widening. The tree root and the handle are the two that
        matter, and they get their own markers so the message still reads. The
        third pass takes out *any* remaining absolute path, and it is the one
        that makes the claim true rather than nearly true: a first version of
        this knew only the root and the handle grammar, and git has other paths
        to talk about. `warning: unable to access '<broker-home>/.gitconfig'`
        is one the broker really can emit, because `$HOME` is deliberately the
        broker's own state dir; `error: could not lock config file <tmp>/...`
        is another. Neither is agent-writable and neither is worth much to an
        attacker, but a claim asserted in four places should not have a list of
        exceptions -- the leak nobody predicted is the whole failure mode here.

        The cost is that an error naming a path says `<path>` instead. The verb
        and the reason survive, which is what a caller can act on anyway; the
        unredacted text goes to the broker's log, where the operator can read
