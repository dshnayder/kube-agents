"""Git working trees the broker owns and the agent cannot name.

The credential proxy runs `git` on the agent's behalf. Until now it ran it in a
directory the agent wrote — the shared PVC — which is the arrangement behind
every code-execution finding this module exists to retire. A repository the
agent can write is a repository whose `.git/config` names programs for git to
run, and the dangerous keys take arbitrary names inside the key
(`filter.<name>.clean`, `alias.<name>`), so there is no finite set to pin. An
enumeration against a surface whose design principle is extensibility does not
terminate; `credential_proxy._GIT_HARDENING_CONFIG` closes eight doors and says
in its own comment that `filter.<driver>` cannot be closed the same way.

So the agent stops handing over a directory and starts handing over content. It
sends `{path, content}` pairs and a commit message; the broker writes them into
a tree the agent has no path to, commits, and pushes. `.git` never exists
anywhere the agent can reach, which closes the class rather than another
instance of it — the agent may still supply a `.gitattributes` naming a filter,
but it cannot supply the `.git/config` that would define one, and an undefined
filter driver is inert.

The check that replaces the enumeration is finite: reject any path under `.git`,
in both directions. One validator serves reads and writes deliberately. A
checker that disagreed with itself about what `manifests/../.git/config` means
would be a parser differential with both halves inside one module, which is the
easiest kind to ship and the hardest to notice.

Nothing in any response is a filesystem path. That is the invariant, written as
something a test can check rather than as an intention: a path handed back is a
directory the agent can be told to `cd` into. A handle is an opaque token; a
`path` is a repository-relative name. It is the same distinction
`CommandExecutor._resolve_kubeconfig` already draws when it treats the caller's
kubeconfig as a name and regenerates the document rather than reading it.
