This is the shell sandbox's /opt/data, on the sandbox's own volume.

It is not the agent pod's Hermes home, which carries the same path and holds
the profiles, the session databases and the model API keys. Nothing is copied
between them and nothing can read across. A handoff that writes a file on one
side and reads it on the other will not work, however identical the path looks.

# 1a. The skills, SOPs and shared scripts the agent's shell runs, from the image
#     onto the volume. The Dockerfile explains what is in each tree and why the
#     staging directory exists at all: the PVC mounts over /opt/data, so anything
#     baked there directly would be invisible the moment a volume is attached.
#
#     Replace rather than merge. `cp` over the top leaves behind a skill deleted
#     from the image and a script renamed in it, and both then sit on the volume
#     looking current for as long as the PVC lives — the same failure the agent
#     pod's step 2.6a exists to prevent, arriving here by the same route. The
#     model's own files belong in $DATA/scratch and $DATA/gitops, which this does
#     not touch; a helper it writes into $DATA/scripts is gone at the next start,
#     and that is the contract rather than an accident.
#
#     Not swallowed. A half-synced tree fails later and somewhere else — as a
#     skill whose script is missing, or a stale one that no longer matches the
#     SKILL.md the agent pod put in the prompt.
#     Once per home root in $SANDBOX_HOME_ROOTS, so the same tree is reachable
#     by the machine-home path and by the profile-home path the SOPs use. They

    # enough that nothing looks wrong: the platform profile is agent-owned, the
    # shell works, every skill works. What fails is creating anything *beside*
    # platform, which is exactly what sandbox_mirror.py does — it extracts one
    # home per profile the agent pod has, and each cluster profile is a mkdir in

#    aside and have this loop populate a replacement it controls. A separate

# 4. The pod's environment, for the agent's shell. sshd does not pass its own
#    environment to sessions — by design, and PermitUserEnvironment is off — so
#    a variable the pod spec sets would otherwise be invisible to every command
#    the agent runs. This forwards an allowlist, not the environment: the pod
#    may hold values that have no business inside the sandbox, and copying it
#    wholesale is how one of them ends up readable there.
#
#    CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL is the one that has to make it across. Without it the
#    kubectl and gcloud wrappers exit 1 with "CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL is not
#    configured" (agents/platform/scripts/credential_proxy_client.py).
#
#    A generated sshd drop-in rather than an /etc/profile.d script, which is
#    what this originally was: profile.d is read by login shells only, and
#    `ssh sandbox kubectl get pods` — the shape of every command Hermes sends
#    once its environment snapshot is taken — is not one. The first build of
#    this image reached the sandbox with PATH correct and CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL
#    empty, so the wrappers resolved and then refused to run.
#
#    PATH is written here too, on the same line, and it has to be: sshd keeps
#    the first SetEnv directive and discards every later one whole, so this
#    cannot be split into a static PATH in sshd_config plus a generated line
#    here. Whichever came first would be the only one that survived. The
#    sshd_config comment carries the same warning from the other side.
#    HERMES_HOME and PLATFORM_AGENT_HOME are static, and set from $DATA rather
#    than forwarded from the pod. Both name a data root, and the two pods' roots
#    are different volumes that only happen to share a path: forwarding the agent
#    container's value would point every skill here at a directory this container
#    does not have the moment an install moves `spec.harness.hermes.agentHome`.
#
#    They have to be set at all because step 1a is only half the delivery. A
#    SKILL.md says `"$HERMES_HOME"/scripts/github_token_refresh.py` as often as it
#    says the literal path, cluster_preflight.sh defaults HERMES_HOME to /opt/data
#    and would silently check the wrong tree if that default ever moved, and
#    gitops_workspace.agent_home() reads PLATFORM_AGENT_HOME to decide where a
#    leased clone goes. sshd starts sessions with neither.

# for a login shell, which is what `kubectl exec -- bash -l` and the smoke test
# get; it cannot be the only place, because `ssh sandbox git log` is not a login
# shell and this SetEnv line is the whole of its PATH. The first build of the
# abstraction relied on profile.d alone and shipped an install where `git` and
# `gh` both still resolved to the credential shim with the feature reported as
# armed — the same failure this comment already described for the wrappers.
#
# The guard is the directory, not the git inside it. Prepending a directory that
# exists and is empty costs nothing, while gating on a binary means a future

# forge-neutral abstraction, and the model takes it: with `gh` reachable, an
# agent given the version-control skill still answered through `gh api` on a
# quarter of the write probes and did not report having done so.
#
# Removed rather than shadowed by a refusing stub, which is what this image
# shipped first. The stub's theory was that a named gap beats a `command not
# found` the model reads as a broken image — the same argument _StubForge in
# vcs_broker.py makes about GitLab. Measured against a build with no `gh` at
# all, that did not hold: the agent never reached for `gh`, never emitted a
# not-found, and finished the write probes faster than it had with the stub.
# The skill already tells it no forge CLI is needed, and that turned out to be
# enough. See docs/designs/version-control-abstraction.md.
#
# The consequence is real and is why the field is still experimental: an install
# that arms versionControl has no `gh` in the sandbox, so the skills that shell
# out to one (fleet-audit, submit-suggestion, github-issue-resolver, the
# governance SOPs) must be ported to the vcs verbs first.
#
