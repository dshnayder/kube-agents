// The shell sandbox: the pod the agent's terminal, file and code-execution tools
// run in once Hermes' `ssh` terminal backend is turned on. Design and rationale
// live in docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md; the image is deploy/sandbox/.
//
// Reconciled only when spec.harness.experimental.shellSandbox.enabled is true, which
// no install sets by default. It stays experimental until #737 Part C gives the
// credential proxy an address of its own (see the credentialProxyURL parameter
// below): without it the sandbox has no credential path at all, so kubectl, gcloud,
// gh and git report that they are unconfigured. That is a usable state for testing
// the file and code-execution tools and not one to ship an agent in.
//
// On the name: "sandbox" already means something else here. The agent's own
// container is the credential-isolation sandbox — see buildSandboxCredentialCleanup
// and safeSandboxEnvOverrides — and that usage predates this file and is load-bearing
// in docs/credential-isolation-design.md. Everything in here is therefore the *shell*
// sandbox, and its objects are named <agent>-shell so no one has to hold both
// meanings at once while reading a `kubectl get`.
//
// On the workload kind: this was going to be a `Sandbox` custom resource from
// kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox. It is a StatefulSet because three of that project's
// four CRDs do not exist in the version that ships, and what does ship maps field for
// field onto this file. The design doc records the evidence, and the interface is
// drawn so that swapping back is this file and nothing else.

// implementation — the reference install has none — so it is a control on clusters
// that enforce it and documentation everywhere else.
//
// Co-location changes both directions, and the egress change is the cost of the
// design rather than a detail. A NetworkPolicy selects pods, so every rule the
// credential proxy needs to reach a GKE control plane, the Google Chat and Slack
// APIs, GitHub and the token broker is a rule the *shell* container gets too:
// putting the two in one pod hands the sandbox the proxy's outbound reach. What
// the design buys is not a smaller network — it is that nothing reachable over
// that network will answer the shell, because the shell holds no credential. The
// metadata server is the one exception worth naming, and it answers the whole pod
