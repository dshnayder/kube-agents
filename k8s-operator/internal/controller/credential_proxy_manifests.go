// The credential proxy, in one of two placements.
//
// **Beside the shell sandbox**, when the sandbox is on and
// spec.security.workloadIdentityFederation names a pool. The proxy is a second
// container in the sandbox's StatefulSet, sharing that pod's loopback and its
// data volume with the shell. This is the placement the design targets and the
// only one in which `git` works, because git's state is the working tree and the
// tree has to be visible from both sides of the exec relay.
//
// **In a Deployment of its own** otherwise. A separate pod cannot mount the
// sandbox's ReadWriteOnce claim, so the proxy falls back to a workspace in its
// own emptyDir: kubectl reads work, `git` and every `-f FILE` write path do not.
// It is also unauthenticated on a ClusterIP, which hands the exec endpoint to
// every pod in the cluster — a NetworkPolicy narrows that where the CNI enforces
// one, and on the reference install (GKE Standard, no Dataplane V2) it does not.
//
// Co-location used to be unavailable for a reason worth restating, because it is
// what spec.security.workloadIdentityFederation exists to remove. GKE resolves
// Workload Identity by *pod IP*, so a sidecar of the sandbox would let the shell
// container curl 169.254.169.254 and mint the proxy's own GSA token — every
// credential the proxy holds, with the policy layer bypassed entirely. Neither
// gVisor nor NetworkPolicy nor automountServiceAccountToken:false closes that:
// gVisor's boundary is the host kernel rather than the network, runtimeClassName
// is pod-scoped, NetworkPolicy is pod-scoped, and Workload Identity does not read
// the projected token file. The pod is the smallest unit that has an IP.
//
// What is *not* pod-scoped is a volumeMount. Federation moves the proxy's cloud
// identity off the metadata server and onto a projected token file mounted into
// this container alone: the pod's ServiceAccount carries no
// iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account annotation, so the metadata server answers both
// containers with an unbound <project>.svc.id.goog principal that IAM grants
// nothing, and the only identity in the pod lives behind a mount namespace the
// shell is not in. shareProcessNamespace stays false so /proc/<pid>/root cannot
// route around that; shell_sandbox_manifests.go pins it and a test asserts it.
//
// The split is by role rather than by copy: the same image runs in both places
// with CREDENTIAL_PROXY_ROLE selecting which of its three services start. See
// deploy/shared/start-services.sh, and the design in
// docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md.
