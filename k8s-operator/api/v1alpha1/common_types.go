	//   - It stops the inflow only. Kanban cards and sessions created from events
	//     already delivered keep running and still have to be dealt with on the board.
	//   - Nothing turns it back on. An install left with the watcher off has no

	// MaxInProgress caps how many kanban workers run concurrently across the whole

	// holding a few hundred MiB for the length of the task: unbounded dispatch lets a
	// burst of queued cards spawn workers until the cgroup OOM killer takes them, and
	// that kills a child process rather than the container, so it produces no Kubernetes
	// event and no restart while the dispatcher strands the card instead of retrying it.
	//
	// The cap is bought at a real price, so raise it deliberately rather than leaving it
	// alone by default. A slot is held for a worker's entire run, so capping serialises
	// minutes of model work: measured against real fan-outs on a live cluster, capping at
	// 2 roughly doubled the time for a batch to finish. Do NOT reach for a lower value as
	// a latency fix — an uncapped fan-out does spawn every sandboxed worker at once and
	// they contend during startup, but a cap trades minutes of model work for seconds of
	// boot. What the workers contend for is not established either — CPU limit, memory
	// ceiling and gVisor I/O all fit the evidence, and gVisor hides the cgroup throttle
	// counters that would settle it — so raising resources is not a guaranteed fix;
	// measure it.
